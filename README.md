# Welcome to Vocabulario!
 Learn your spanish vocabulary quickly and easily with this powerful app.

## Important
 This project is in development. Please do not use it now.

## SUPER IMPORTANT!!!!
 If you want to build this yourself, you will need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
 (or just the SDK). **Please note:** This project was originally created using Google Firebase. When I
 published this source code to GitHub, I added the file containing all the Firebase IDs to the gitignore.
 Your version might crash upon execution but it is because you don't have the Firebase IDs. If such an
 error occurs, be sure to comment out the affected lines.
